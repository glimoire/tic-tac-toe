# Ye Olde Tic-Tac-Toe

Overview

Welcome to Ye Olde Tic-Tac-Toe, a humble website harkening back to a simpler time. Built for Code Institute's Javascript project, the sandy tones and simple design will bring back fond memories of drawing symbols in the sand with your best friend Casserole Jack in the blistering heat of the Arizona Frontier, regardless of whether or not that actually happened to you.

Enjoy this game with your friends on the go, at home, or in any life-or-death situation you happen to find yourself in! Truly, Ye Olde Tic-Tac-Toe is the game of the people.

Features

- Personalized WIN screens so your friends can't gaslight you again!
