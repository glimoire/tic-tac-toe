Ye Olde Tic-Tac-Toe

--Overview--
Welcome to Ye Olde Tic-Tac-Toe, a humble website harkening back to a simpler time. Built for Code Institute's Javascript project, the sandy tones and simple design will bring back fond memories of drawing symbols in the sand with your best friend Casserole Jack in the blistering heat of the Arizona Frontier, regardless of whether or not that actually happened to you.

Enjoy this game with your friends on the go, at home, or in any life-or-death situation you happen to find yourself in! Truly, Ye Olde Tic-Tac-Toe is the game of the people.

Features
- Not one, not three, but TWO player action! Play as the callous crosses or the noble naughts!
- WIN or DRAW conditions! There is no losing when you're among friends.
- Personalized WIN screens so your friends can't gaslight you again! 
- A reset button! Now you don't have to buy a new phone every time a round ends!
- A full range of 6 or 7 colours, depending on how you look at it!
- A cool header image, inspired by the beautiful works of my old-fashioned neighbour Buckshot Bob!
